<h1 style="text-align: left;">Overview:</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">This project focuses on automating test cases for <a href="https://qtripdynamic-qa-frontend.vercel.app/" target="_blank">QTrip</a>, a travel website similar to makemytrip. The automation framework was built using Java, Selenium, and TestNG, following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.<br />During the project, the following tasks were accomplished:<br />Designed and automated 4+ test cases using Page Factory, Selenium, and TestNG.<br />Utilized Apache POI to handle dynamic test data in each test case.<br />Created a TestNG project to manage and run the automated test cases efficiently.<br />Implemented the Singleton pattern to initialize the WebDriver, ensuring resource optimization.<br />Generated detailed and customized test reports using Extent Reports.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<h2>Scope of Work:</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: left;">Executed the major user flows in the QTrip application manually to gain a thorough understanding of the system.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Analyzed test cases to determine which ones to automate.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Defined the pages and corresponding actions, converting manual test cases into automated scripts based on the Page Object Model.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Automated four different test cases to test core functionalities of the QTrip Application.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Used Apache POI to perform data-driven testing.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Grouped test cases into functional categories to execute them in a custom sequence as needed.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Extended built-in Selenium methods by adding custom functionality.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Implemented Wrapper methods for taking screenshots and retrying failed tests.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Generated detailed and customized test reports using Extent Reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Skills used:</h2>
<p>Java, Selenium, Locators, HTML, Xpath, Developer Tools, TestNG, Page Object Model,&nbsp;Generate Customized Test Reports using Extent Reports, Wrapper Methods, Singleton Design pattern.</p>
<h2>Project Structure:</h2>
<ul>
<li>The project follows the TestNG framework and POM design pattern. Each page in the application is represented as a class in the framework, and actions performed on the pages are methods within those classes. This structure ensures that tests are maintainable and scalable.</li>
<li><strong>Key Technologies and Tools</strong></li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>Selenium</li>
<li>TestNG</li>
<li>Apache POI (for reading/writing Excel data)</li>
<li>Extent Reports (for generating test reports)</li>
<li>Page Object Model (POM) design pattern</li>
<li>Test Reports: Test execution results are stored and reported using Extent Reports. These reports provide a detailed view of the tests that were executed, including pass/fail statuses, screenshots on failure, and more.</li>
</ul>
