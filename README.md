Overview: 
This project focuses on automating test cases for QTrip, a travel website similar to makemytrip. The automation framework was built using Java, Selenium, and TestNG, following the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern.
During the project, the following tasks were accomplished:
Designed and automated 4+ test cases using Page Factory, Selenium, and TestNG.
Utilized Apache POI to handle dynamic test data in each test case.
Created a TestNG project to manage and run the automated test cases efficiently.
Implemented the Singleton pattern to initialize the WebDriver, ensuring resource optimization.
Generated detailed and customized test reports using Extent Reports.

Scope of Work:
Executed the major user flows in the QTrip application manually to gain a thorough understanding of the system.
Analyzed test cases to determine which ones to automate.
Defined the pages and corresponding actions, converting manual test cases into automated scripts based on the Page Object Model.
Automated four different test cases to test core functionalities of the QTrip Application.
Used Apache POI to perform data-driven testing.
Grouped test cases into functional categories to execute them in a custom sequence as needed.
Extended built-in Selenium methods by adding custom functionality.
Implemented Wrapper methods for taking screenshots and retrying failed tests.
Generated detailed and customized test reports using Extent Reports.
Skills used:
Page Object Model, Test Case Design, Java, Selenium, TestNG, XPath
Automate QTrip Test Cases with TestNG
Java, Selenium, Locators, HTML, Developer Tools, TestNG, Page Object Model, XPath
Generate Customized Test Reports for TestNG Project
Extent Reports, Wrapper Methods
Project Structure:
The project follows the TestNG framework and POM design pattern. Each page in the application is represented as a class in the framework, and actions performed on the pages are methods within those classes. This structure ensures that tests are maintainable and scalable.
Key Technologies and Tools
-Java
-Selenium
-TestNG
-Apache POI (for reading/writing Excel data)
-Extent Reports (for generating test reports)
-Page Object Model (POM) design pattern
-Test Reports
Test execution results are stored and reported using Extent Reports. These reports provide a detailed view of the tests that were executed, including pass/fail statuses, screenshots on failure, and more.
